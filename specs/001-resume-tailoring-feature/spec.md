# Feature Specification: Resume Tailoring

**Feature Branch**: `001-resume-tailoring-feature`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Resume tailoring feature where users can paste a job posting and get back a customized resume. The system should analyze the job requirements, match them against my stored profile data, and generate a tailored resume that highlights relevant experience. Include human-in-the-loop approval before final output, and ensure all analysis is done through AI agents rather than traditional parsing scripts."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- <� **Simplicity First**: Feature should be explainable in 2 sentences
- > **Agent-Chain Focused**: Every feature = chain of focused agents, no traditional parsing/processing
- =� **No Traditional Code**: If it involves "parsing" or "analyzing" � use agents, not scripts

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has found a job posting they want to apply for. They paste the job description into the system, which analyzes the requirements and matches them against their stored profile data. The system generates a customized resume highlighting their most relevant experience and skills. Before finalizing, the user reviews and approves the tailored resume, then downloads it for their application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has stored profile data and a job posting, **When** they paste the job description and request tailoring, **Then** the system analyzes requirements and generates a customized resume draft
2. **Given** a tailored resume draft is generated, **When** the user reviews it, **Then** they can approve, request modifications, or reject the draft
3. **Given** a user approves the tailored resume, **When** they request the final output, **Then** the system provides a downloadable resume file
4. **Given** insufficient profile data exists, **When** a user requests resume tailoring, **Then** the system identifies missing information and prompts for additional details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the job posting contains unclear or minimal requirements?
- How does the system handle when user profile lacks relevant experience for the job?
- What occurs if the AI agents cannot extract meaningful requirements from the job posting?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input job posting text via paste or upload
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze job requirements using AI agents (not traditional parsing)
- **FR-003**: System MUST match job requirements against stored user profile data
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a tailored resume highlighting relevant experience and skills
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide human-in-the-loop approval workflow before final output
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to review, approve, modify, or reject generated resume drafts
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide final resume in downloadable format upon approval
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify and communicate when insufficient profile data exists for effective tailoring
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve user's original profile data while creating tailored versions
- **FR-010**: System MUST accept job posting text via paste input and extract key requirements
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate final resume in Markdown format
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist user profile data (single user system) without retaining individual tailoring sessions

### Key Entities
- **User Profile**: Comprehensive professional data including:
  - Contact information (name, email, phone, location)
  - Professional summary/objective
  - Work experience (positions, companies, dates, achievements with metrics)
  - Education (degrees, institutions, dates, honors)
  - Skills (hard and soft skills, certifications)
  - Optional sections (projects, publications, awards, volunteer work, languages)
- **Job Posting**: External job description containing requirements, responsibilities, qualifications, and company information
- **Tailored Resume**: Customized Markdown version of user's profile optimized for specific job requirements
- **Analysis Session**: Temporary AI agent analysis including extracted requirements, matching logic, and customization decisions (not persisted)
- **Approval Workflow**: Human review process with user feedback, modifications, and final approval status
