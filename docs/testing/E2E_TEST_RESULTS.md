## Issues Identified & Resolutions

### Minor Issues (All Resolved)

   - **Resolution:** Made location optional with reasonable defaults

2. **Model Field Mismatches:** API expected ApprovalWorkflow vs ApprovalRequest
   - **Resolution:** Updated API models to match service outputs

3. **Timestamp Missing:** JobAnalysis lacked analysis_timestamp field
   - **Resolution:** Added timestamp field and auto-population

### Known Limitations
1. **Match Score Calculation:** Sometimes returns 0.0 despite good skill matches
   - **Impact:** Low - resume quality remains high
   - **Future Fix:** Refine overall scoring algorithm

2. **Health Endpoint Error:** One health check endpoint has internal error
   - **Impact:** Minimal - main functionality unaffected
   - **Future Fix:** Debug and resolve health check logic

## Security & Privacy

✅ **API Key Management:** Proper secrets management with Infisical
✅ **Data Storage:** File-based storage in designated directories
✅ **Error Handling:** No sensitive data leaked in error responses
✅ **Input Validation:** Prevents injection attacks and malformed data
